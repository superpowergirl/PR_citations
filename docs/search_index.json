[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results One of the major networking or social aspect of the academic research community is authors writing papers and citing other authors work. But as the corpus of research articles is huge, very few authors and their papers get a very high number of citations for their work. Sidney Redner in her paper, Citation Statistics from 110 Years of Physical Review - http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/pubs/pdf/PT.pdf - calls out this somewhat alarming statistical phenomenon as follows - A somewhat depressing observation is that nearly 70% of all PR articles have been cited fewer than 10 times. Also evident is the small number of highly cited publications The histogram confirms that the data is heavily right skewed. A large number of papers receive very few citations. ## cited_doi n ## Length:563557 Min. : 1.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.: 3.00 ## Mode :character Median : 6.00 ## Mean : 14.77 ## 3rd Qu.: 15.00 ## Max. :10763.00 In order to look at the citations received closely, we divide the dataframe based on the citation_count and assigned them labels. The box plot below validates our observation further, where we can clearly see that the papers that receive very high citations are sparse and are dispersed. We then ask the question - are there any patterns associated with journal categories? From the chart above, we can see that all categories are right skewed. However, the number of citations is more concentrated around zero in some categories, such as PR, PRA, PRB, PRC and PRD while less concentrated in other categories such as PRAB, PRFLUIDS and PRAER. After exploring the data around citations received across all articles, we look at the evolution of publications and citations over time. First, we look at the publications data over time to see if there exists any long term secular patterns. Not surprisingly, the number of publications has increased with time. However, the trend is not entirely upward. The number of publications declined from 2012 to 2015 and then recovered from there. We are curious whether the number of citations received by papers will exhibit a similar pattern as the number of publications. Based on our data (1893-2019), the number of citations generally went up over time and reached the peak in 2008, which means that paper published in 2008 received the highest number of citations. We think it makes sense to see an inflection point since paper published too long ago might be out of date while paper published in recent years have not had enough time to be cited by other papers. It is interesting to see that the year 2008 is the peak, indicating that on average it takes about 12 years for a paper to receive the highest number of citations. To further explore, we faceted on months from January to December to see if there exists any seasonal patterns. While we see a similar pattern across all months in the chart above, instances of extremely high citations were associated with papers published in October, March and July. After exploring the number of citations a paper received over time, we looked into how long on average it takes for a paper to receive a citation. Interestingly but perhaps not too surprisingly, the average time it takes for a physics paper to be cited by other physics papers generally goes down as times goes by. The downward trend has been especially clear since 1980. The growing popularity in social media has enabled researchers to promote their work more efficiently, such as opening a Facebook page to encourage casual discussion of their papers or opening a Twitter account and tweet about their paper. Moreover, research shows that tweeting results in significantly more article citations over time, highlighting the durable scholarly impact of social media activity. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520308602) In order to uncover interesting points of our data, we do a deep dive into and a detailed analysis for Year 2008 We are interested in studying the physics papers published in 2008 when the number of citations reached record high. To start with, we used interactive parallel coordinates to identify outliers and the relationship between different categorical variables, such as journal categories, paper length, number of authors and number of citations. The parallel coordinates plot shows us some interesting trends. First, in contrast to general belief, number of authors is negatively correlated with paper length. Second, most journal categories have author counts spread from 1 to 25 while two categories - RMP and PRSTPER have relatively fewer authors. We suspect this is because these two categories are review articles of other physics papers and therefore have few authors associated with them. A few outliers jump out from the graph. For instance, one paper in RMP has the highest paper length but was written by fewer than 5 people and received very few citations. Moreover, the paper that received the highest number of citations and relatively high paper length has fewer than 5 authors. Furthermore, we would like to see how the number of citations varies across journal categories for the publications in 2008. We focus on the following categories that have meaningful number of total citations in 2008: PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE and PRL. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) Note: We picked 6 and 15 to be the breaks so that the number of citations for each interval will be meaningful across all categories. ## &lt;6 [6,15) &gt;=15 ## 7166 5271 4672 The mosaic plot above shows that most papers published in 2008 were in PRB and RPL and that papers in PRL, PRC and PRD received much higher number of citations than PRE, since the percentage of papers with more than 6 citations was much higher in RPL, PRC and PRD than PRE. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) All in all, we were able to see some interesting trends in 2008. Lastly, we do a deep dive on some factors that contribute to the citations received by papers across all the years in our dataset (1893-2019). We begin by looking at the attributes of the paper - length of the paper, and length of the title of the paper. Length of the title of a paper - An article in the Nature magazine claims that papers with shorter titles get more citations. We wanted to see if this was applicable to articles/papers published in the physical review journal. And we do see a decrease in number of citations as the length of the title of the paper becomes longer as shown by the scatter plot below. Note: For this calculation, we remove the papers where titles have a math function in them. This is because the title length includes html tags in them making the title length longer than the actual title. Length of the paper - A study by Tahatman, Afshar, Ahamdzadeh on papers published WoS, Scopus, PubMed and Medline believes that longer papers get more citations because they contain more information. (Factors affecting number of citations: a comprehensive review of the literature). We see that phenomenon in physical review journal papers as well as shown in the scatter diagram below. Now we try to look at the people or social aspect of citations. We want to see what social factors, if any, play a role in increasing or decreasing citations received. First, we look at whether or not the number of authors of an article has an effect on the number of citations received by a paper. The scatter diagram below shows the average number of citations received by articles that have a given number of authors. As we saw in the parallel coordinates plot for 2008 papers, we do suspect a slight negative correlation between citations received by a paper and its number of authors, overall in our dataset. The above result was a little contrary to our belief. So we look at the effect of number of co-authors of an author and how does that help authors receive citations for their articles/papers. We see that an increase in collaboration does play a role in increasing citations, but the effect does not hold beyond a certain number of coauthors. First, the increasing trend of citations as coauthors increase from 0-15 could be due to the fact that co-authored papers are presented in more scientific networks such as conferences, seminars, etc. which boosts their citations. We do see a decreasing trend in citations beyond 15 co-authors. Thus we are able to see some interesting dynamics between the characteristics of papers and the citations received by papers. We also see how co-authorship plays a role in boosting citations upto a certain degree of the number of co-authors. "]]
