Einsteins papers on relativity does not feature in the top 100 cited papers. Interesting and a bit surprising, dont you think? We deep-dive into a data set of paper citations in the field of physics, to explore and visualize the evolution of these papers and their citations with time, and also look at what potential factors contribute to high citations in the field of physics review journal articles. In order to look at popular authors and the citations their papers receive, we look at authors that have received a nobel prize in physics and explore the affect of their fame on the citations their papers have received. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We analyze citation data about Physical Review Journal articles published by the American Physical Society (APS). APS has made available to researchers data based on their publications for use in research about networks and the social aspects of science. Physical Review Journals are divided into various categories based on the field of physics and type of articles published in the journals. More detail can be found here - https://journals.aps.org/about Here is a brief overview of the categories - PRL (Physical Review Letters)  weekly coverage of major advances in physics and cross-disciplinary developments PRX (Physical Review X)  online-only, open access, peer-reviewed. Publishes exceptional original research papers from all areas of pure,applied and interdisciplinary physics. PRA (Physical Review A)  atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information PRB (Physical Review B)  condensed matter and material physics PRAB  Physical Review Accelerator and Beams PRC (Physical Review C)  Nuclear Physics PRD (Physical Review D)  particles, fields, gravitation, and cosmology PRE  statistical, nonlinear, biological, and soft matter physics PRApplied  all aspects of experimental and theoretical applications of physics PRFluids  online-only, fundamental understanding of fluids PRMaterials  research on materials PRPER - Physics Education Research PRRESEARCH  all research topics of interest to the physics community PRSTAB PRSTPER RMP  Reviews of Modern Physics  indepth review articles The datasource is not publicly available for download. We requested access to it by filling out a web inquiry form, and data was made available to us for download in the form of downloadable links. Below is a description of our data source from the APS data set website - https://journals.aps.org/datasets The data source has information about more than 450,000 (656,622 to be exact) articles spanning the period between 1893 and 2019. Two data sets that were made available to us, and that we have worked with are as follows - Citing article pairs: This data set consists of pairs of APS articles that cite each other. For instance, if article A cites article B, there will be an entry in the data set consisting of the pair of DOIs for A and B. This data set is formatted as a comma-separated values (CSV) file consisting of the DOI pairs, one pair per line. Note that this data only consists of APS articles that cite other APS articles. There could be articles that they cite outside of APS, but we do not have the data for it in our dataset. So the citations given and citations received will be a lower bound of the actual numbers. Article metadata: This data set consists of the basic metadata of all APS journal articles. This data is in json format, one json file for each article. The metadata provided includes the following fields: DOI, journal, volume, issue, first page and last page OR article id and number of pages, title, authors, affiliations, publication history, PACS codes, table of contents heading, article type, and copyright information. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Data clean up and transformation was the most challenging part of our project, given the complex nature and size of the data set. We provide a summary here. There are additional steps we have performed that we have excluded here for conciseness. We can provide details if required. We have the complete code of our transformation in python and R in our repository. Transformation in Python: The bulk of the data cleanup and transformation of our raw metadata was done using Python. The code is in our repository here - https://github.com/superpowergirl/PR_citations/tree/main/datatransformation_python Below is a brief of how we transform the json metadata into two dataframes in python. We then converted these dataframes into two comma separated values (csv) files and imported them into R for further cleanup and transformation as applicable for our analysis. Dataframe 1 - A dataframe with paper_doi as the primary key and relevant columns from the metadata file Each article has a corresponding json file that has its metadata. We parse through all the json files in python and generate a dataframe with the relevant columns we would need for analysis. We have 656622 such articles, and hence our final dataframe has 656622 rows - one for each article. As an example, let us look at one row of the dataframe corresponding to one article. Please refer to the Data Sources section for a representation of the metadata json file for a particular article. While generating this dataframe, we ensure that we take care of the following - we filter out the author type that is not Person because there are instances where a survey group organization might be an author. We match the affiliation Ids of authors to the names corresponding to those Ids and add them in the paper_affiliations column. Dataframe 2 - A dataframe with (paper_doi,author_name,author_affiliation) as the composite primary key and relevant columns from Dataframe 1 As we wanted to look closely at how the factors related to authors, such as their affiliation, their number of co-authors, affect the citations their articles receive, we created a long dataframe where each row was an author, affiliation, and doi. In this dataframe, we have as many rows for a particular author as equal to the number of Physical Review Journal articles they have published. One thing we noticed in the raw metadata is that an author can be affiliated to more than one organization/institute. For ease of our analysis, we are only keeping one affiliated organization per author. Also, if we do not have the affiliation information for an author, we are discarding it from this particular dataframe for ease of analysis. The number of rows discarded is small (detail in the Missing Values section). A sample extract of the final dataframe is shown below. In this sample, we have the all the authors of a specific paper as separate row of the dataframe- Clean up and Transformation in R: The above was an initial transformation that we did in Python.After we ingest the the citation pairs csv (provided as a data set) and the two generated metadata csvs from python above, we do some further clean up to remove any missing values. These 3 dataframes form the basis for performing all our analysis, by combining different columns from them and doing calculations on them to generate more dataframes that were used to create visualizations. We provide the code related to these specific transformations within the results section. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We read data from two transformed csv files as mentioned in the Data transformation section. One of the files contains the metadata about an article/paper (details are mentioned in the Data sources section). Here is a summary of the missing values per column. ## X paper_doi ## 0 0 ## paper_journal_category paper_pub_date ## 0 0 ## paper_length paper_authors ## 10861 0 ## paper_authors_count paper_affiliations ## 0 0 ## paper_title ## 0 The paper_length is measured in number of pages. We have a few of the papers as shown above for which we do not have this information. There are few others where the length is 0. ## n ## 1 15541 A plot for the paper_length missing and 0 values are shown as below. We do not delete these rows entirely from our data as there are other columns which we use for some of our visualizations. But we filter it out from our calculation when we look at the affect of just the length of paper on the number of citations received. In the metadata csv we also have some papers that have author information missing, and some have authors but do not have their affiliations information. There are {r}metadata%&gt;%filter(paper_authors =='[]')%&gt;%count() such observations. They appear in the dataframe as [] and we count those to get a number of missing author information. In order to look at author dependent visualizations, we created another transformed csv in python which has the author information and their papers. So we look at only those authors-papers data where author info is available. We are not using the author affiliation information in our visualization, so we leave them as it is. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results One of the major networking or social aspect of the academic research community is authors writing papers and citing other authors work. But as the corpus of research articles is huge, very few authors and their papers get a very high number of citations for their work. Sidney Redner in her paper, Citation Statistics from 110 Years of Physical Review - http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/pubs/pdf/PT.pdf - calls out this somewhat alarming statistical phenomenon as follows - A somewhat depressing observation is that nearly 70% of all PR articles have been cited fewer than 10 times. Also evident is the small number of highly cited publications The histogram confirms that the data is heavily right skewed. A large number of papers receive very few citations. ## cited_doi n ## Length:563557 Min. : 1.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.: 3.00 ## Mode :character Median : 6.00 ## Mean : 14.77 ## 3rd Qu.: 15.00 ## Max. :10763.00 In order to look at the citations received closely, we divide the dataframe based on the citation_count and assigned them labels. The box plot below validates our observation further, where we can clearly see that the papers that receive very high citations are sparse and are dispersed. We then ask the question - are there any patterns associated with journal categories? From the chart above, we can see that all categories are right skewed. However, the number of citations is more concentrated around zero in some categories, such as PR, PRA, PRB, PRC and PRD while less concentrated in other categories such as PRAB, PRFLUIDS and PRAER. After exploring the data around citations received across all articles, we look at the evolution of publications and citations over time. First, we look at the publications data over time to see if there exists any long term secular patterns. Not surprisingly, the number of publications has increased with time. However, the trend is not entirely upward. The number of publications declined from 2012 to 2015 and then recovered from there. We are curious whether the number of citations received by papers will exhibit a similar pattern as the number of publications. Based on our data (1893-2019), the number of citations generally went up over time and reached the peak in 2008, which means that paper published in 2008 received the highest number of citations. We think it makes sense to see an inflection point since paper published too long ago might be out of date while paper published in recent years have not had enough time to be cited by other papers. It is interesting to see that the year 2008 is the peak, indicating that on average it takes about 12 years for a paper to receive the highest number of citations. To further explore, we faceted on months from January to December to see if there exists any seasonal patterns. While we see a similar pattern across all months in the chart above, instances of extremely high citations were associated with papers published in October, March and July. After exploring the number of citations a paper received over time, we looked into how long on average it takes for a paper to receive a citation. Interestingly but perhaps not too surprisingly, the average time it takes for a physics paper to be cited by other physics papers generally goes down as times goes by. The downward trend has been especially clear since 1980. The growing popularity in social media has enabled researchers to promote their work more efficiently, such as opening a Facebook page to encourage casual discussion of their papers or opening a Twitter account and tweet about their paper. Moreover, research shows that tweeting results in significantly more article citations over time, highlighting the durable scholarly impact of social media activity. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520308602) Recall that in 2008, the number of citations reached a record high. We are interested in further studying the papers published that year to uncover any unusual patterns. Hence, we did a deep dive into Year 2008. To start with, we used interactive parallel coordinates to identify outliers and the relationship between different categorical variables, such as journal categories, paper length, number of authors and number of citations. The parallel coordinates plot shows us some interesting trends. First, in contrast to general belief, number of authors is negatively correlated with paper length. Second, most journal categories have author counts spread from 1 to 25 while two categories - RMP and PRSTPER have relatively fewer authors. We suspect this is because these two categories are review articles of other physics papers and therefore have few authors associated with them. A few outliers jump out from the graph. For instance, one paper in RMP has the highest paper length but was written by fewer than 5 people and received very few citations. Moreover, the paper that received the highest number of citations and relatively high paper length has fewer than 5 authors. Furthermore, we would like to see how the number of citations varies across journal categories for the publications in 2008. We focus on the following categories that have meaningful number of total citations in 2008: PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE and PRL. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) Note: We picked 6 and 15 to be the breaks so that the number of citations for each interval will be meaningful across all categories. ## &lt;6 [6,15) &gt;=15 ## 7166 5271 4672 The mosaic plot above shows that most papers published in 2008 were in PRB and RPL and that papers in PRL, PRC and PRD received much higher number of citations than PRE, since the percentage of papers with more than 6 citations was much higher in RPL, PRC and PRD than PRE. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) All in all, we were able to see some interesting trends in 2008. Lastly, we do a deep dive on some factors that contribute to the citations received by papers across all the years in our dataset (1893-2019). We begin by looking at the attributes of the paper - length of the paper, and length of the title of the paper. Length of the title of a paper - An article in the Nature magazine claims that papers with shorter titles get more citations. We wanted to see if this was applicable to articles/papers published in the physical review journal. And we do see a decrease in number of citations as the length of the title of the paper becomes longer as shown by the scatter plot below. Note: For this calculation, we remove the papers where titles have a math function in them. This is because the title length includes html tags in them making the title length longer than the actual title. Length of the paper - A study by Tahatman, Afshar, Ahamdzadeh on papers published WoS, Scopus, PubMed and Medline believes that longer papers get more citations because they contain more information. (Factors affecting number of citations: a comprehensive review of the literature). We see that phenomenon in physical review journal papers as well as shown in the scatter diagram below. Now we try to look at the people or social aspect of citations. We want to see what social factors, if any, play a role in increasing or decreasing citations received. First, we look at whether or not the number of authors of an article has an effect on the number of citations received by a paper. The scatter diagram below shows the average number of citations received by articles that have a given number of authors. As we saw in the parallel coordinates plot for 2008 papers, we do suspect a slight negative correlation between citations received by a paper and its number of authors, overall in our dataset. The above result was a little contrary to our belief. So we look at the effect of number of co-authors of an author and how does that help authors receive citations for their articles/papers. We see that an increase in collaboration does play a role in increasing citations, but the effect does not hold beyond a certain number of coauthors. First, the increasing trend of citations as coauthors increase from 0-15 could be due to the fact that co-authored papers are presented in more scientific networks such as conferences, seminars, etc. which boosts their citations. We do see a decreasing trend in citations beyond 15 co-authors. Thus we are able to see some interesting dynamics between the characteristics of papers and the citations received by papers. We also see how co-authorship plays a role in boosting citations upto a certain degree of the number of co-authors. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Nobel prize winners and their most cited papers In this section, we take a look at a few of the nobel prize winners in the field of physics between the years 1990 and 2010. More specifically, we take a look at their most cited physical review journal paper (based on the number of citations it has received from other physical review journal papers), and see how has the papers citations evolved with time since it was first cited. Please use the interactive graph below to choose a nobel prize winning author to look at the time series. .line { fill: none; stroke: blue; stroke-width: 1.5px; } Nobel Prize winners and their most cited physical review journal papers Select a winner from the dropdown to see the time series of citations received on their most cited paper As you can see, for these subset of authors that won the Nobel prize in Physics between 1990 and 2009, the time series has interesting peaks and troughs. We look at a few interesting cases below - Roy J Glauber (2005 Nobel prize winner) - Their most cited paper received a lot of initial interest immediately after its publication. Subsequently, there was a drop-off until the year of their nobel prize win, after which, possibly due to increased publicity and awareness, the paper received renewed interest and the citations for that paper show an increasing trend. In the graph, the red line is the year when the author wins the nobel prize. And for the aforementioned author, we can see this renewed interest on the right side of the red line. David J Gross and David Politzer (shared the Nobel prize in 2004) - Their most cited physics review journal paper respectively, have a very similar time series evolution. Their papers also show similar renewd interest after their nobel prize win. Carl Wiemann (2001 Nobel prize winner) - Not all nobel prize winning authors most cited papers show the above mentioned renewed interest trend in our data. Carl Wiemmans most cited papers has a more or less flat trend. We believe it could be because in our data set we do not have citations received by a paper from journal papers outside of physical review journals. If we had that data, we might have seen a different trend altogether, and would be able to draw a more clear conclusion. We have excluded some nobel prize winners between 1990-2010 from our analysis (and hence from the dropdown above). Their most cited papers have either not received any citations in a long time, and hence none after their nobel prize winning year, or the citations for their most cited physics review journal paper has decreased after their nobel prize win. We speculate this could be for two reasons. First, not all physics nobel prize winners primarily publish in the physics review journal. Their most cited paper or more popular paper might be in some other journal. And as we do not have data of citations from outside physics review journals, we cant say for certain what causes this trend. For future analysis, we can either look at papers of winners across all journals and find the most cited from that list, or we can look at the citations evolution of papers which are more relevant to their field if study for which they win the nobel prize. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After analyzing the citation patterns of physical review journals, we find that the majority of these papers receives very few citations, which is particularly evident in categories such as PRA, PRB, PRC and PRD. (See definition of each category on Data sources page.) Based on our data from 1893 to 2019, while the number of publications generally goes up over time, the number of citations received by papers experiences a time lag. We find that on average it takes about 12 years to witness the highest number of citations received by papers published in a given year. Furthermore, the average time it takes for papers to receive their citations have been on a consistent downward trend in recent years. We think this phenomenon is partially caused by the growing popularity of social media, which has been studied by other researchers and proven to be true. "]]
