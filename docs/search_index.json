Einsteins papers on relativity does not feature in the top 100 cited papers. Interesting and a bit surprising, dont you think? We deep-dive into a data set of paper citations in the field of physics, to explore and visualize the evolution of these papers and their citations with time, and also look at what potential factors contribute to high citations in the field of physics review journal articles. In order to look at popular authors and the citations their papers receive, we look at authors that have received a nobel prize in physics and explore the affect of their fame on the citations their papers have received. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We analyze citation data about Physical Review Journal articles published by the American Physical Society (APS). APS has made available to researchers data based on their publications for use in research about networks and the social aspects of science. Physical Review Journals are divided into various categories based on the field of physics and type of articles published in the journals. More detail can be found here - https://journals.aps.org/about Here is a brief overview of the categories - PRL (Physical Review Letters)  weekly coverage of major advances in physics and cross-disciplinary developments PRX (Physical Review X)  online-only, open access, peer-reviewed. Publishes exceptional original research papers from all areas of pure,applied and interdisciplinary physics. PRA (Physical Review A)  atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information PRB (Physical Review B)  condensed matter and material physics PRAB  Physical Review Accelerator and Beams PRC (Physical Review C)  Nuclear Physics PRD (Physical Review D)  particles, fields, gravitation, and cosmology PRE  statistical, nonlinear, biological, and soft matter physics PRApplied  all aspects of experimental and theoretical applications of physics PRFluids  online-only, fundamental understanding of fluids PRMaterials  research on materials PRPER - Physics Education Research PRRESEARCH  all research topics of interest to the physics community PRSTAB PRSTPER RMP  Reviews of Modern Physics  indepth review articles The datasource is not publicly available for download. We requested access to it by filling out a web inquiry form, and data was made available to us for download in the form of downloadable links. Below is a description of our data source from the APS data set website - https://journals.aps.org/datasets The data source has information about more than 450,000 (656,622 to be exact) articles spanning the period between 1893 and 2019. Two data sets that were made available to us, and that we have worked with are as follows - Citing article pairs: This data set consists of pairs of APS articles that cite each other. For instance, if article A cites article B, there will be an entry in the data set consisting of the pair of DOIs for A and B. This data set is formatted as a comma-separated values (CSV) file consisting of the DOI pairs, one pair per line. Note that this data only consists of APS articles that cite other APS articles. There could be articles that they cite outside of APS, but we do not have the data for it in our dataset. So the citations given and citations received will be a lower bound of the actual numbers. Article metadata: This data set consists of the basic metadata of all APS journal articles. This data is in json format, one json file for each article. The metadata provided includes the following fields: DOI, journal, volume, issue, first page and last page OR article id and number of pages, title, authors, affiliations, publication history, PACS codes, table of contents heading, article type, and copyright information. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Data clean up and transformation was the most challenging part of our project, given the complex nature and size of the data set. We provide a summary here. There are additional steps we have performed that we have excluded here for conciseness. We can provide details if required. We have the complete code of our transformation in python and R in our repository. Transformation in Python: The bulk of the data cleanup and transformation of our raw metadata was done using Python. The code is in our repository here - https://github.com/superpowergirl/PR_citations/tree/main/datatransformation_python Below is a brief of how we transform the json metadata into a dataframe in python. We then converted this dataframe into a comma separated values (csv) file and imported them into R for further cleanup and transformation as applicable for our analysis. Each article has a corresponding json file that has its metadata. We parse through all the json files in python and generate a dataframe with the relevant columns we would need for analysis. We have 656622 such articles, and hence our final dataframe has 656622 rows - one for each article. As an example, let us look at one row of the dataframe corresponding to one article. Please refer to the Data Sources section for a representation of the metadata json file for a particular article. While generating this dataframe, we ensure that we take care of the following - we filter out the author type that is not Person because there are instances where a survey group organization might be an author. We match the affiliation Ids of authors to the names corresponding to those Ids and add them in the paper_affiliations column. Clean up and Transformation in R: The above was an initial transformation that we did in Python.After we ingest the the citation pairs csv (provided as a data set) and the two generated metadata csvs from python above, we do some further clean up to remove any missing values. These 3 dataframes form the basis for performing all our analysis, by combining different columns from them and doing calculations on them to generate more dataframes that were used to create visualizations. We provide the code related to these specific transformations within the results section. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We read data from a transformed csv file as mentioned in the Data transformation section. The file contains the metadata about an article/paper (details are mentioned in the Data sources section). Here is a summary of the missing values per column. ## X paper_doi ## 0 0 ## paper_journal_category paper_pub_date ## 0 0 ## paper_length paper_authors ## 10861 0 ## paper_authors_count paper_affiliations ## 0 0 ## paper_title ## 0 Meta data Columns and their description - 1. X - index of the column 2. paper_doi - DOI/ID of the paper 3. paper_journal_category - Type of physics review journal where the paper is published 4. paper_pub_date - Date of paper publication 5. paper_length - Number of pages 6. paper_authors - Authors of the paper 7. paper_authors_count - Number of authors of the paper 8. paper_affiliations - Affiliations of authors 9. paper_title - Title of the paper The paper_length is measured in number of pages. We have a few of the papers as shown above for which we do not have this information. There are few others where the length is 0, and the number if shown below. ## n ## 1 15541 A plot for the paper_length missing and paper_length 0 values are shown as below. As we have a lot of rows in our data set, we graph the missing values by dividing our data into 3 different time periods - 1893-1949, 1950-2000, and 2001 - 2019 as shown below. One thing to note in all the graphs above - Not all categories of physics review journal papers came into effect at the same time. For instance, PRI papers were the earliest and got discontinued after 1912. PR and RMP paers came in later, and all other categories came to exist in subsequent years. Hence we see white gaps in our graphs. These are not missing data, but just that a category did not exist until a certain time. We see that between 1893 - 1949, there is paper_length missing for a few PR, PRI, and RMP papers. PR and RMP journal categories start in the year 1913 and 1928 respectively. We have a few missing paper_length information between 1949-2000. But after 2000, we do not have any missing paper_length. We do not delete these rows entirely from our data as there are other columns which we use for some of our visualizations. But we filter it out from our calculation when we look at the affect of just the length of paper on the number of citations received. In the metadata csv we also have some papers that have author information missing, and some have authors but do not have their affiliations information. They appear in the dataframe as [] and we count those to get a number of missing author information. There are 10440 such observations, which is approximately 1% of our total records. ## n ## 1 10440 For author information dependent graphs, we exclude these records from our dataset for calculations. Lastly, in our main data file that has pair-wise citations, we do not have any records missing as shown below. ## citing_doi cited_doi ## 0 0 "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Frequency Distribution of Citations received by papers 5.2 Are there any frequency distributions associated with journal categories? 5.3 Time series analysis of physical review papers 5.4 A deep-dive into the year 2008 5.5 What helps (or does not help) papers to be cited?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Frequency Distribution of Citations received by papers One of the major networking or social aspect of the academic research community is authors writing papers and citing other authors work. But as the corpus of research articles is huge, very few authors and their papers get a very high number of citations for their work. Sidney Redner in her paper, Citation Statistics from 110 Years of Physical Review - http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/pubs/pdf/PT.pdf - calls out this somewhat alarming statistical phenomenon as follows - A somewhat depressing observation is that nearly 70% of all PR articles have been cited fewer than 10 times. Also evident is the small number of highly cited publications In our dataset, we have 563,557 papers, with a median citations received value as 6, and a mean citations received value ~15, which is not very high. ## cited_doi n ## Length:563557 Min. : 1.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.: 3.00 ## Mode :character Median : 6.00 ## Mean : 14.77 ## 3rd Qu.: 15.00 ## Max. :10763.00 The histogram further confirms that the data is heavily right skewed. A very few papers receive more than 20 citations as shown below. (We choose number of citations received &lt;50, as there are very few papers in each bucket more than 50 citations) We also plot the histogram of papers which have citations received between 50 and 500 separately to show that the y-scale is different in this graph by several orders of magnitude compared to the above graph. Together the above and below graph cover almost 99% of the papers in our data set. The change in scale indicates the sharp power law relationship between the number of papers receiving a given number of citations. 5.2 Are there any frequency distributions associated with journal categories? The different categories of Physical review papers,based on the topics they cover, have been defined in the section on data sources. From the chart above, we can see that the citation received histogram of all categories are right skewed. However, the number of citations is more concentrated around zero in some categories, such as PR, PRA, PRB, PRC and PRD while less concentrated in other categories such as PRAB, PRFLUIDS and PRAER. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) 5.3 Time series analysis of physical review papers After exploring the data around citations received across all articles, we look at the evolution of publications and citations over time. First, we look at the publications data over time to see if there exists any long term secular patterns. Not surprisingly, the number of publications has increased with time. However, the trend is not entirely upward. The number of publications declined from 2012 to 2015 and then recovered from there. We are curious whether the number of citations received by papers will exhibit a similar pattern as the number of publications. Based on our data (1893-2019), the number of citations generally went up over time and reached the peak in 2008, which means that paper published in 2008 received the highest number of citations. We think it makes sense to see an inflection point since paper published too long ago might be out of date while paper published in recent years have not had enough time to be cited by other papers. It is interesting to see that the year 2008 is the peak, indicating that on average it takes about 12 years for a paper to receive the highest number of citations. To further explore, we faceted on months from January to December to see if there exists any seasonal patterns. While we see a similar pattern across all months in the chart above, instances of extremely high citations were associated with papers published in October, March and July. After exploring the number of citations a paper received over time, we looked into how long on average it takes for a paper to receive a citation. Interestingly but perhaps not too surprisingly, the average time it takes for a physics paper to be cited by other physics papers generally goes down as times goes by. The downward trend has been especially clear since 1980. The growing popularity in social media has enabled researchers to promote their work more efficiently, such as opening a Facebook page to encourage casual discussion of their papers or opening a Twitter account and tweet about their paper. Moreover, research shows that tweeting results in significantly more article citations over time, highlighting the durable scholarly impact of social media activity. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520308602) 5.4 A deep-dive into the year 2008 Recall that in 2008, the number of citations reached a record high. We are interested in further studying the papers published that year to uncover any unusual patterns. Hence, we did a deep dive into Year 2008. To start with, we used interactive parallel coordinates to identify outliers and the relationship between different categorical variables, such as journal categories, paper length, number of authors and number of citations. The parallel coordinates plot shows us some interesting trends. First, in contrast to general belief, number of authors is negatively correlated with paper length. Second, most journal categories have author counts spread from 1 to 25 while two categories - RMP and PRSTPER have relatively fewer authors. We suspect this is because these two categories are review articles of other physics papers and therefore have few authors associated with them. A few outliers jump out from the graph. For instance, one paper in RMP has the highest paper length but was written by fewer than 5 people and received very few citations. Moreover, the paper that received the highest number of citations and relatively high paper length has fewer than 5 authors. Furthermore, we would like to see how the number of citations varies across journal categories for the publications in 2008. We focus on the following categories that have meaningful number of total citations in 2008: PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE and PRL. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) Note: We picked 6 and 15 to be the breaks so that the number of citations for each interval will be meaningful across all categories. ## &lt;6 [6,15) &gt;=15 ## 7166 5271 4672 The mosaic plot above shows that most papers published in 2008 were in PRB and RPL and that papers in PRL, PRC and PRD received much higher number of citations than PRE, since the percentage of papers with more than 6 citations was much higher in RPL, PRC and PRD than PRE. (The definition of each category is shown on page Data sources.) All in all, we were able to see some interesting trends in 2008. 5.5 What helps (or does not help) papers to be cited? Lastly, we do a deep dive on some factors that contribute to the citations received by papers across all the years in our dataset (1893-2019). Note: There are outliers in the data viz. very few papers have very high citations, very few papers have more than 25 authors, very few papers are more than 50 pages long, etc. Hence, we choose median for our calculations below as we do not want the outliers to skew the measures. 5.5.1 What role do the attributes of a paper - length of the paper, and length of the title of the paper - play? Length of the title of a paper - An article in the Nature magazine claims that papers with shorter titles get more citations - https://www.nature.com/news/papers-with-shorter-titles-get-more-citations-1.18246. We wanted to see if this was applicable to articles/papers published in the physical review journal. We plot the average number of citations received by papers with a given title length. As shown in the scatter plot below, we do see a decreasing trend in the median number of citations as the length of the title of the paper becomes longer. Note: For the above calculation, we remove the papers where titles have a math function in them. This is because the title length includes html references in them making the title length longer than the actual title. 25% of papers in our dataset have such titles, and we exclude them from this calculation only. We believe that 75% of our dataset is a good representation of the entire dataset of 656,622 observations. Length of the paper - A study by Tahatman, Afshar, Ahamdzadeh on papers published WoS, Scopus, PubMed and Medline believes that longer papers get more citations because they contain more information. (Factors affecting number of citations: a comprehensive review of the literature- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-1889-2). We observe this phenomenon in physical review journal papers shown in the scatter diagram below. Note: For the above calculation, we look at papers that have receieved &lt;=500 total citations, as very few papers (less than 15% of our data set) have very high citations. We do this to reduce noise in our data. 5.5.2 Are there any social aspects at play? Now we look at the people or social aspect of citations. We want to see what social factors, if any, play a role in increasing or decreasing citations received. Authors of a paper - the more the merrier? First, we look at whether or not the number of authors of an article has an effect on the number of citations received by a paper. The scatter diagram below shows the median number of citations received by papers that have a given number of authors. We believe collaboration/networking helps in boosting the citations of a paper. Having a co-author is always helpful than working alone, but it looks like when the number of authors increases beyond 3, the median citations stay flat until 15 authors, and then increase again and go downward beyond ~18 co-authors. As we have data of only physics paper citing physics paper, there might be much more citations received by the paper from other journals like IEEE, etc. We believe that an overall number of citations could indicate a stronger correlation between citations and number of authors, but we are not certain about it. A paper entitled The relationship between the number of authors of a publication, its citations and the impact factor of the publishing journal: Evidence from Italy -https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715200557 - mentions that the review articles in the field of physics show a high positive correlation between the number of citations received and the number of authors. From the scatter plot below, that contains only RMP (Review of Modern Physics) papers,we see that the median citations is higher than the median citations compouted across all categories in the graph above. And even though a high positive correlation is not evident in the below graph, the inclusion of citations outside of physics review journals might provide a clearer evidence. ` Thus we are able to study some interesting factors in play - social factors (authors) and quality of a paper(length and title) - that affect the citations received by papers. In the next section, we look at how does the citation count of most cited physics papers of Nobel prize winners evolve with time, and what happens before and after their Nobel prize year. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this section, we take a look at a few of the nobel prize winners in the field of physics between the years 1990 and 2010. More specifically, we take a look at their most cited physical review journal paper (based on the number of citations it has received from other physical review journal papers), and see how has the papers citations evolved with time since it was first cited. Please use the interactive graph below to choose a nobel prize winning author to look at the time series. .line { fill: none; stroke: blue; stroke-width: 1.5px; } Nobel Prize winners and their most cited physical review journal papers Select a winner from the dropdown to see the time series of citations received on their most cited paper As you can see, for these subset of authors that won the Nobel prize in Physics between 1990 and 2009, the time series has interesting peaks and troughs. We look at a few interesting cases below - Roy J Glauber (2005 Nobel prize winner) - Their most cited paper received a lot of initial interest immediately after its publication. Subsequently, there was a drop-off until the year of their nobel prize win, after which, possibly due to increased publicity and awareness, the paper received renewed interest and the citations for that paper show an increasing trend. In the graph, the red line is the year when the author wins the nobel prize. And for the aforementioned author, we can see this renewed interest on the right side of the red line. David J Gross and David Politzer (shared the Nobel prize in 2004) - Their most cited physics review journal paper respectively, have a very similar time series evolution. Their papers also show similar renewd interest after their nobel prize win. Carl Wiemann (2001 Nobel prize winner) - Not all nobel prize winning authors most cited papers show the above mentioned renewed interest trend in our data. Carl Wiemmans most cited papers has a more or less flat trend. We believe it could be because in our data set we do not have citations received by a paper from journal papers outside of physical review journals. If we had that data, we might have seen a different trend altogether, and would be able to draw a more clear conclusion. We have excluded some nobel prize winners between 1990-2010 from our analysis (and hence from the dropdown above). Their most cited papers have either not received any citations in a long time, and hence none after their nobel prize winning year, or the citations for their most cited physics review journal paper has decreased after their nobel prize win. We speculate this could be for two reasons. First, not all physics nobel prize winners primarily publish in the physics review journal. Their most cited paper or more popular paper might be in some other journal. And as we do not have data of citations from outside physics review journals, we cant say for certain what causes this trend. For future analysis, we can either look at papers of winners across all journals and find the most cited from that list, or we can look at the citations evolution of papers which are more relevant to their field if study for which they win the nobel prize. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After analyzing the citation patterns of physical review journals, we find that the majority of these papers receive very few citations, which is particularly evident in categories such as PRA, PRB, PRC and PRD. (See definition of each category on Data sources page.) Based on our data from 1893 to 2019, while the number of publications generally goes up over time, the number of citations received by papers experiences a time lag. We find that on average it takes about 12 years to witness the highest number of citations received by papers published in a given year. Furthermore, the average time it takes for papers to receive their citations have been on a consistent downward trend in recent years. We think this phenomenon is partially caused by the growing popularity of social media, which has been studied by other researchers and proven to be true. Based on our analysis, we also see that there are a couple of factors, such as the paper length, paper title, and number of authors that play some role in contributing to the number of citations received by a paper. The correlation between citations received and number of authors of the paper provides evidence of social cues in physics research community. Lastly, the interactive section on Nobel prize winners and their most cited papers provides us with some interesting trends in the evolution of citations received by the most cited papers of Nobel prize winners.
